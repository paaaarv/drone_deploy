# Drone Data Query Application

This application allows users to query drone data through a React frontend interface, with a Python backend handling API requests and AI-powered data retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm 6+

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

2. Create a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required Python packages:
5. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your AI service API key:
6. Start the backend server:
    ````
    fastapi dev main.py
    ````
The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.


## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
2. Install the required npm packages:
    ````
    npm install
    ````

3. Start the React development server:
    ````
    npm start 
    ````

The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Using the Application

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. You'll see a table or card format displaying drone data.
3. Use the input box to enter queries about the drone data, such as:
- "What is the battery level of the drone during the last image?"
4. The application will display the AI-generated response based on your query.


## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python with FastApi
- Frontend: React
- AI Service: OpenAI

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all prerequisites are correctly installed.
2. Verify that both backend and frontend servers are running.
3. Check console logs for any error messages.
